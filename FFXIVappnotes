FFXIV Progress Generator!
First Time Setup,
Enter level fields for all jobs [alt. pull from lodestone.]
Optional entering fields for iLVL for jobs.
Enter field for currency. [Can we retrieve the *total* amount of gil a player has ever accrued?]

[Button - Save to File] [Button - Load from File]

Save to file pushes a new value to an array called progressLog[i]
  If the user tries to push a new progressLog value to a log that already has 11 values, it will let them know that it will overwrite the most recent log. Instead of pushing, it will save the values to progressLog[10]

var jobArray["DRG", "RED", "BLM", ...];
var levelArray[61, 70, 12];
var iLvlArray[];
string charName
val dateStamp;
//date stamp in format of 12-31-XXXX

Display works as an underlying bar of the most recent progressLog value. It then stacks up on itself until (i=0) is reached. To the right of the bar is a numerical value.
for (var i = progressLog.length; i >= 0; i--)
{
    There should be a defined bar color for each class. I.e. Red for Red Mage.
    The most recent bar should be the most vibrant/saturated. It should decrease in hue as i decreases.
    colorHue = 0. + "i";
    //this formula will only work well if the maximum length of timestamps is 9;
    if (i = 10)
    {
    colorHue = 1;
    }
    if (i = 0)
    {
    colorHue = 0.05;
    }

    rgba(255, 0, 0, colorHue);
    //where hue is most vibrant at 1, least at 0.


    create bar[DRG];
    create bar[RDM];
    create bar[MNK];

}
