- Grid based combat.


- Map is loaded in.
- Player's turn.
- Player can move cursor around the map. When cursor is over a selectable unit, the cursor will highlight.
- Upon pressing Z, the unit is then selected. A blue movement area will appear based on where the unit is. It will be influenced by how large the map is, as well as if there is anything blocking their way.
- The player can move the cursor anywhere that is blue.
- If the player presses Z again, the player moves to that space. Input is ceased while the player moves, it will not be instantaneous.
- A check will be run to see if the player is adjacent to an enemy.
    - Yes
    The player will be able to select a red space, which will be lit if there is an adjacent enemy.
      If a space is selected/confirmed, battle will start.
    - No
- The player ends their turn, and the player is no longer selectable.
- We loop this until all players have moved.
